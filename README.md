## ESYS 300 - Readme

*McGill University*\
*Fall 2021*

This is a repository dedicated to storing various MATLAB labs, exercises, and projects for ESYS 300.

This repository also serves as a tool to practice the following:
- Windows Powershell commands,
- Git workflow in the Windows environment,
- Markdown formatting (for this Readme)

Labs 1 - 8 focus on parsing various data sources, generating charts, and analyzing trends.
The final labs focus on the Signal Processing & Image Processing toolboxes, as well as GUI creation using the almost-deprecated GUIDE system.
